# Song Recommender Project :headphones:

This is my submission for the GNOD project at Ironhack where I built a Song Recommender to discover new songs which sound similar to the one you are thinking of.

For the data to be used:

1. Create a dataset of the Billboard Hot 100 songs containing song name and artist name). 
2. Create a random database of 3000 songs from another database (Web Scraping)
3. Extracted song features using Spotify's API through Spotipy on Python. This song feature data is used in the building of the K-Means Clustering model. Attention: to make the final function work you need to have a config file containing your own SpotifyAPI credentials
